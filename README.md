# Lessons learned

The use of props where its properties can be used in other files. For example skipSong and currentSongIndex are properties of parent class in another file where it determines whether the song is skipped or currently playing according to the user.

# Potential future features

If a current song has finished playing, the app should automatically skip to the next song, without the user needing to click skip button.
Potentially getting rid of white background around the play and length of song to make the music player look cleaner.
