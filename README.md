# Getting Started with Create React App

This project was bootstrapped with [Create React App](https://github.com/facebook/create-react-app).

# Deployment 

https://music-player-random-customize.netlify.app/

# Lessons learned 

The use of props where it stores data regarding the list of songs, current song currently played and the next song after current one is finished. 


# Potential future features 
An api that stores a variety of music potentially where the user can add more songs to their music player application. 
Desing of the play button and length of song could be more better to be more user friendly.
